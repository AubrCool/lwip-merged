This is a merge of trunk lwip and lwip-contrib.
It contains the two official git trees, updated in sync.
It will hopefully be updated by a script.

lwip    from git://git.sv.gnu.org/lwip.git
contrib from git://git.sv.gnu.org/lwip/lwip-contrib.git

This is needed for my buildbot building lwip unix targets.
